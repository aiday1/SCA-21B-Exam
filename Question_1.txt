Explain how the Git Show command works.
Each commit has an identifier (they say "hash"),
the hash is usually given already shortened 8 characters.
Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits).
For commits it shows the log message and textual diff.
It also presents the merge commit in a special format 
as produced by git diff-tree --cc.
